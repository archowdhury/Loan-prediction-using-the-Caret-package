This project aims at predicting the customers likely to default on a Loan. The main objective is to demonstrate how to use the Caret package for easily creating multiple models and then selecting the best one.

The things you can learn from this:
1) Imputing missing values using KNN
2) Using dummyVars for "One hot encoding"
3) Feature selection using the RFE function of the Caret package
4) How to use a k-fold validation technique while creating models
5) Using a control grid to fine tune the various models
6) Building various models - GBM, RandomForest, Neural Net, Logistic
7) Evaluating the models and finding the best one
